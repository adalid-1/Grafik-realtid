you have to manually put the resources folder into the make dir of project 3, 4 and 5  
Controlls:  
mb 1 rotates camera, wasd moves camera, q and e for up and down the y axis of the camera. mb2 rotates a model.  
Project 5 is the most polished so far when it comes to cleaning up memory and trying to not hardcode stuff.  
in assignment 5 you can move the light with arrow keys and move it along the world z axis with F(orward) and R(everse)
